# Connector for the CPU and Blitter

## Context

In order to reach the target dimension (given _surface_), it will be acceptable to _stack_ element vertically.

The following specification will allow to stack the CPU, and the blitter for setups that require it (namely, with a MCU without integrated blitter). Both will be stacked over the MCU.

## Physical layout

The overall goal is to have : 

* The biggest square with an side length rounded to 10s of mils, that fits a 10Ã—10cm square.
* Two head 100mils pitched header connectors, each 2 rows of different number of contacts, vertically oriented, put on a diagonally opposite corners of the square. 
  * **Connector A** will be on the north of the west side.
  * **Connector B** will be on the south of the east side. 
  * When one card is plugged on the main board or another card, the connector casing are flush with the borders

> TODO : a map with measurement, expressed in mils.

## Connector specifications

The following pin assignments have been devised to minimize routing to the MCU, hopefully.

Pin numbers are assigned as follow :

* Connector seen from above, vertically oriented : the two rows are vertical, columns are horizontal.
* From left to right, columns by columns
