## 1. What is **Sporniket's 'ReSTe mignon'**, and when to use it ?

**Sporniket's 'ReSTe mignon'** is a _RE_-make of the computer known as 'Atari _STe_', on a B5-sized (250Ã—175 mm) PCB. Smaller, so 'cute', hence '_mignon_'.

This is a project made with [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/). I started this work [from the conversion of the original Atari STe schematics](https://github.com/sporniket/kicad-conversions--atari-ste-motherboard--c300780-001).

A github releases will provide :

* A standalone Kicad project (all custom libraries included and ready to use)
* A PDF of the schematics
* A PDF of the silkscreen

If appropriate, a github release MAY provide :

* A Gerber for boardmanufacturer. Some details may have been adapted for a specific manufacturer.
* A BOM, and pick an place files, likely for a specific manufacturer too.
